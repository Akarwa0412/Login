Overview – Automation of the login page

The project aims to automate the GermanyIsCalling web-based application using Selenium WebDriver. Once the application is launched, we will be redirected to the login page where we have to automate the process of login.There we have created the three test cases with valid,invalid and null input values. We have also generated the extent report of the test cases. 

Plugins and Dependencies

•Selenium Java: 4.23.1
•TestNG: 7.10.2
•Extent Report: 5.1.1
